You can get help on campus with this stuff!

You are welcome to bring questions to the Women in Information and Computer Science office hours (Katie used to be president).

They have office hours in Gould-Simpson 737, Monday 11-1 and Wednesday 1-3
If the door is closed, knock on the door, or use the code 4-5-6-7-8

Contact WICS officers at uofa.wics@gmail.com, if they aren't too busy they are happy to help with questions.
